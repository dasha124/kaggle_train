Description:
A unique identifier for each individual case.
Sex:
Type: Categorical (Male, Female)
Description: The sex of the individual.
%Red Pixel:
Type: Float
Description: The percentage of red pixels in the image associated with the case.
%Green Pixel:
Type: Float
Description: The percentage of green pixels in the image associated with the case.
%Blue Pixel:*
Type: Float
Description: The percentage of blue pixels in the image associated with the case.
Hb:
Type: Float
Description: Hemoglobin level of the individual, measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).
Anaemic:
Type:Catagorical (Yes | No )
